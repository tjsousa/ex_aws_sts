# ExAws.STS

Service module for https://github.com/ex-aws/ex_aws

## Installation

The package can be installed by adding `ex_aws_sts` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`
along with `:ex_aws` and your preferred JSON codec / http client

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:ex_aws, "~> 2.0"},
    {:ex_aws_sts, "~> 2.0"},
    {:poison, "~> 3.0"},
    {:hackney, "~> 1.9"},
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/ex_aws_sts](https://hexdocs.pm/ex_aws_sts).

## Role based authentication

AWS CLI config files are supported, but require an additional dependency:

```elixir
{:configparser_ex, "~> 2.0"}
```

`ExAws.STS` allows to authentication based on `role_arn` and `source_profile` as specified in the 
`awscli` config file.
 When specified in your `~/.aws/config` you can set 
  
```
config :ex_aws,
  secret_access_key: [{:awscli, "profile_name", 30}],
  access_key_id: [{:awscli, "profile_name", 30}],
  awscli_auth_adapter: ExAws.STS.AuthCache.AssumeRoleCredentialsAdapter
```

and if the profile `profile_name` sets a `role_arn` then this will make ExAws 
issue an `AssumeRoleCredentials` request to fetch the `access_key_id` 
and `secret_access_key`.

## Web Identity for Role based authentication

Similarly, it is possible to use a web identity token to perform the assume role operation. It currently uses the following env vars to obtain it:

`AWS_WEB_IDENTITY_TOKEN_FILE`: path of the file with the web identity token
`AWS_ROLE_ARN`: role to be assumed

```
config :ex_aws,
  secret_access_key: [{:awscli, "profile_name", 30}],
  access_key_id: [{:awscli, "profile_name", 30}],
  awscli_auth_adapter: ExAws.STS.AuthCache.AssumeRoleWebIdentityAdapter
```
